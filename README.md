## Apple Tree

* Personal project.
* A fruitarian version of the game traditionally known as 'hangman'.
* Try to guess the hidden word letter by letter.  For every incorrect guess an apple falls.  If all the apples fall before you guess the whole word, you lose!
* A Ruby/Sinatra app, TDDed using RSpec and Capybara.
* Uses an API request to 'setgetgo.com' to generate a random word.
* Uses a second API request to 'oxforddictionaries.com' to give you the definition of the word when the game ends.
* You can play it <a href='http://sample-env.x5bkmmyqkj.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com'>here</a>!
